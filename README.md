# ft_printf
A remake of the C printf function made for 42School

Same as ``printf()`` but home-made!  
Try it right now with ``ft_printf()``.  

Here is the list of variables it currently takes :
```c
%c print a single character.
%s print a string of characters.
%p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
%d print a decimal (base 10) number.
%i print an integer in base 10.
%u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
%x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase.
%X print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase.
%% print a percent sign.
```
I'm waiting for your PR :)
